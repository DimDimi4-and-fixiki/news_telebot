# news_telebot
My telegram bot for getting news. <br />This bot basically sends you some news on topics you chose at the time you chose.<br /> It is a link you can follow to actually test my telegram bot. If bot doesn't answer, it is OK. It means that I am just working on it or testing some feature. You will get full access as soon as it would be deployed on Heroku, so wait for a while.<br />Don't hesitate to support the projecs, this would give me some inspiration :)

## DONE:
  - Data Base connection
  - Handle a lot of commands
  - English and Rissian are added
  - Custom markup keyboards for choices

## TODO:
  - Deploy it on Heroku
  - Send news on timing
